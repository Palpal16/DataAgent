1. install visual studio c++ components, using vs studio installer, consider also insatlling MVC 1.43 and slang
2. Build with cmake
3. Install Ninja

1. Agent to call external API, connect to MCPP Protocol to provide LLMS accesing external tools in automatic ways
2. Then we run all this kind this way (optional)
Implement something in Blur, spice and matrix
3. Work with runnin on c++ with templates or runnign with some specific metrics, using frameworks, orchestator in c++
4. Lets have a diagram of how everything interact
5. Look the energy consumption
6. Demo with orchestrator and how interact, describe the matrix and documentate code, launc a command in c++, reads the text file and automate all things
launching the gmeter, energy consumption and metrics, running the load, calculate how many users and stuff, option of best of n,
do template c++ for running this
7. Prepare a presentation for the demo

Last steps:
Evaluation of Visualization Agent
Reinforcement Learning Parameter Tuning
